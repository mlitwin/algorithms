# Algorithms in JavaScript

## Design goals

Javascript isn't build to be super fast. So we will aim for convenience of use over raw speed.

- "Fast Enough"
- Use the flexibility of JavaScript, e.g. allow heterogeneous collections of objects.
- Assume data structures fit comfortably in memory.
- Take advantage of the "undefined" vs "null" JavaScript distinction.
